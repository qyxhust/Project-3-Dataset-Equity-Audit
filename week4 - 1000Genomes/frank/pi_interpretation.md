Across the four superpopulations, both π and H_S follow the pattern **AFR > SAS > EUR ≈ EAS**. A key process behind this is **genetic drift**, which means random changes in allele frequencies from one generation to the next just due to chance (who happens to have how many kids). Drift is stronger in small populations, where random sampling can push alleles quickly to 0 or 1, and weaker in large populations, where allele frequencies change more slowly. Over long time scales, large populations with weaker drift can **hold on to more variants**, especially when you also consider the higher supply of new mutations. This fits human history: modern humans originated in Africa, and African populations have had a **larger effective population size (Nₑ)** for a longer time than non-African groups. As a result, they have had more time and more individuals in which neutral mutations can arise and remain polymorphic, leading to the highest π and H_S in AFR.

For non-African populations, we see **SAS > EUR ≈ EAS**. This pattern is consistent with a history that includes several **bottleneck events** after humans left Africa. A bottleneck is a period when the population size drops sharply for some time, which makes drift stronger and causes random loss of alleles, leaving a “scar” of reduced diversity that can persist even after the population grows again. As humans expanded from Africa into West Asia, then South Asia, and only later into Europe and East Asia, different groups went through these bottlenecks to different degrees. South Asian populations are closer to the early expansion routes and many show evidence of **admixture**—mixing between distinct ancestral lineages (for example, West Eurasian–related and South/East Eurasian–related groups). Admixture tends to increase within-population diversity by bringing together alleles that evolved in different backgrounds, which helps explain why SAS often has higher π and H_S than EUR and EAS. Europeans and East Asians, which went through additional or stronger bottlenecks and periods of relative isolation, end up with lower diversity and similar levels to each other.

Natural selection also shapes diversity, but usually in a more local way along the genome rather than changing the global ranking of populations. **Background (purifying) selection** removes deleterious mutations and nearby linked variants, while **positive selection** can rapidly increase the frequency of beneficial alleles and reduce variation around them; both processes can create local dips in diversity. However, our results show that **across the genome**, both π (average pairwise differences per site) and H_S (fraction of heterozygous sites per individual) give the same ordering AFR > SAS > EUR ≈ EAS. This strongly suggests that **demographic history**—especially long-term differences in effective population size and the impact of bottlenecks after the Out-of-Africa expansion—is the main driver of the diversity patterns we observe among these superpopulations.
