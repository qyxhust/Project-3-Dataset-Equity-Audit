# Project-3-Dataset-Equity-Audit
Biomedical datasets often underrepresent populations, leading to biased research. Users frequently use these datasets without questioning their representativeness. This project aims to create a tool to identify and address these gaps, making datasets more representative for equitable downstream applications.
