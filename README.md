# Project-3-Dataset-Equity-Audit
Biomedical datasets often underrepresent key demographic and ancestral groups, leading to biased research outcomes and inequitable healthcare solutions. Researchers and practitioners frequently rely on these datasets without evaluating their representativeness or the downstream consequences of such gaps. This project aims to design a scalable Dataset Equity Audit Tool that quantifies and visualizes demographic representation across major genomic and biomedical datasets (e.g., 1000 Genomes, TCGA, gnomAD). By integrating diversity indices, population genetics metrics, and missingness analyses, the tool will highlight disparities and provide actionable insights for improving dataset inclusivity. Ultimately, our goal is to empower scientists, policymakers, and data custodians to identify, measure, and mitigate representation gaps, fostering more equitable and generalizable biomedical research.
