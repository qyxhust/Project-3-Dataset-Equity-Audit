FST is short for Fixation Subpopulation relative to Total population. 
- It measures genetic differentiation between populations.
- It ranges from 0 to 1, and tells you how genetically different two populations are from each other.
 

Pairwise FST is calculated by iterating through every combination of superpopulations
- It takes into account inter and intrapopulation genetic diversity
- It returns three arrays: 
    - between population variance per variant (a)
    - within population variance per variant (b)
    - sample size correction per variant (c)

Final FST is sum(a) / sum(a) + sum(b) + sum(c)

Looking at our heatmap in /fst_heatmap.png, we can see that:
- there is the most genetic differences between the AFR superpopulation and all other superpopulations
- All other superpopulations have very little pairwise FST metrics, <0.01.
    - This means there isn't much difference genetically between all other superpopulations.
